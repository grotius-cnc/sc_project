1.	Pvec.front().vo value is not always showing up, fix the sc_engine to do this.
	This is already fixed for pvec.back().ve

2. 	The sc_planner has to react to the lowered velmax for arc's.
	How to implement this? Maybe modify the live-velmax if motion is of type arc.
	



Done:

- For user to define a nice gforce value for arc's we need a gforce gui calculator.
